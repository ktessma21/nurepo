# nurepo - Clone Git

A small repository implementation example and utilities.

Clone

- git clone https://github.com/ktessma21/nurepo.git
- cd nurepo

Build

- make

Notes (kept from original file)

- make sure all the testing repos should be untracked. so put them in .gitignore file to tell git to untrack them.
- biggest formatting problem is they use \t for \tab
- Using OpenSSL library for generating sha256 and sha1
